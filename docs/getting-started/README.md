# Getting Started

### Launching the server on your local machine
- Install Node `v5.5.0`
- Make sure npm is installed: `npm --version`
- Go to the project directory: `cd schedule-app`
- Install all needed packages: `npm install`
- Launch the server: `npm start`
- Open the app in your browser at `localhost:3000`.

### Using Glup

- Use gulp to start the server. The browser should automatically open
- If any changes are made to .ejs or .css files, the browser will automatically reload to reflect the changes.
